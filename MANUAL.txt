Tomb v0.01
MANUAL

Welcome to the Tomb.
Tomb is a roguelike game with a setting in the ancient burial ground of a long lost ruler.
Your goal as the adventurer is to brave the depths of the labyrinths and corridors and retrieve
the icon of the weedaula so that peace can be restored in your nearby village.

The tomb, items, and enemies are randomly generated so it guarantees no game is ever the same.
