Tomb: The Rogue-like
Tomb is a roguelike written in C++ using the libtcod library.

Playing Tomb:
Tomb should be built before it is ran.
At command line, type in the command

make run

Afterwards, you can run the command ./tomb or double click the executable file to start the game.

Developing Tomb:
This repository comes with the code::blocks project files I'm using to develop Tomb.
Alternatively, there is a makefile that cleans, builds, and runs the project.
